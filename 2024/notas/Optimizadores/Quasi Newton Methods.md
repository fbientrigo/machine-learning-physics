The blog titled "BFGS in a Nutshell: An Introduction to Quasi-Newton Methods" provides an introduction to the mathematical formulation of BFGS optimization, which is a widely used quasi-Newton method in the field of machine learning. The author aims to explain what BFGS is, how it works, and why it was developed in a accessible manner. The article begins by reviewing gradient descent, which is an iterative method for finding a local minimum of a real-valued, differentiable objective function. The author then discusses the limitations of gradient descent and introduces quasi-Newton methods as an alternative.

The focus of the article is on the mathematical derivation of BFGS optimization rather than its application in code. The author explains that quasi-Newton methods aim to address the deficiencies of basic optimization methods by using second-order information (approximations of the Hessian matrix) to find the minimum. BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno) is specifically introduced as the most widely used quasi-Newton method.

The article takes a gradual approach by first discussing basic optimization methods and their deficiencies before diving into quasi-Newton methods and BFGS. The author aims to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of the motivation behind developing BFGS and its place within the landscape of optimization methods.
