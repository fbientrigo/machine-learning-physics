# Solve the inverse problem of an Schrodinger like equation

Solving the inverse problem of finding the potential from the spectrum is a challenging task in quantum mechanics. The approach typically involves formulating an optimization problem to find the potential that reproduces the observed spectrum.

One common method is the inverse scattering method, which involves reconstructing the potential by inverting the scattering data. This method uses the scattering matrix to extract information about the potential, and then applies a numerical algorithm to reconstruct the potential.

Another approach is to use the WKB (Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) approximation, which is a semiclassical method that approximates the wave function in terms of classical trajectories. This method provides an approximate solution to the Schr√∂dinger equation, and can be used to extract information about the potential.

Deep learning techniques have also been used to solve inverse problems in quantum mechanics. For example, neural networks can be trained to predict the potential from the spectrum, by minimizing the difference between the predicted spectrum and the observed spectrum.

However, solving the inverse problem of finding the potential from the spectrum remains an active area of research in quantum mechanics, and there is no general solution that can be applied to all cases. The specific approach used will depend on the nature of the potential, the form of the spectrum, and the available computational resources.
